Hi! I'm a first year Masters student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in working in Reinforcement Learning and its applications in games and beyond. I also have a good programming and math background which enables me to implement and test my ideas. I love breaking my head over Ted-Ed puzzles and occasionally solving jigsaw puzzles :)

### Research
Using auxiliary tasks,such as object detection to initialize agents to play [Starcraft 2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) to improve sample efficiency with Prof. Zsolt Kira from College of Interative Computing.
